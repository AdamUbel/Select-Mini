## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A "Select Mini" 3D printer.
- [Firmware](link-to-firmware-repo) for your printer.
- [3D printing software](link-to-slicer-software) (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura) installed on your computer.

## Configuration File

The configuration file (`select_mini.cfg`) in this repository contains settings for your "Select Mini" 3D printer. These settings include parameters such as print speed, layer height, temperatures, and more. You can use this configuration as a starting point for your 3D printing projects.

## Usage

1. Download the `select_mini.cfg` file from this repository.

2. Open your preferred 3D printing software (e.g., PrusaSlicer).

3. Load your 3D model.

4. Import the `select_mini.cfg` file as a custom printer profile. Refer to your software's documentation for instructions on how to import a configuration file.

5. Apply the "Select Mini" configuration to your 3D model.

6. Adjust any additional settings specific to your project, such as infill density or support structures.

7. Slice your 3D model and generate G-code.

8. Transfer the G-code to your printer and start the printing process.

## Customization

You can customize the `select_mini.cfg` file to match your specific requirements. Open the file in a text editor and modify the settings as needed. Below are some common settings you might want to customize:

- Print speed
- Layer height
- Extruder and bed temperatures
- Print bed size
- Retraction settings

Remember to save your changes and re-import the updated configuration into your 3D printing software.
